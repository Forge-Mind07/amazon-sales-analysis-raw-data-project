Amazon Sales Data Analysis (Python + Pandas)

This project analyzes a raw Amazon sales log taken from Kaggle.
The goal was to work with real-world messy data — including inconsistent price formats, missing values, string-based percentage fields, and noisy category information — and extract meaningful product and category insights using Python and Pandas.

The focus is on data cleaning, preparation, segmentation, and business-focused metrics.

  *** Key Features of the Analysis ***
   
( 1. Price Cleaning & Transformation )
    
Removed ₹ symbols and commas

Stripped whitespace

Converted string prices to numeric types

Dropped invalid and zero-value prices



( 2. Product-Level Metrics )

Calculated:

Total Revenue per product

Units Sold

Average Selling Price (ASP)

Top Products by Revenue



( 3. Category-Level Insights )

Identified:

Categories with highest revenue

Average discount % per category

Count of products priced above category average



( 4. Discount Analysis )

Cleaned and converted discount_percentage

Computed Top Products by Average Discount %
